# Functional Requirements

1. **Register**  
**Reason:** To login users should register first.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This one of the standard features for this app. Prototyping because while creating the basic paper prototyping for the app we get to know this must be included in the app flow.  

2. **Login**  
**Reason:** To save the progress of the story and continue where left.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This is one of the standard features for this app. Prototyping because while creating the basic paper prototyping for the app we get to know this must be included in the app flow.  

3. **Create new story**  
**Reason:** To create a new story from scratch.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This is the basic and obvious feature for our application.  

4. **Logout**  
**Reason:** The user must be able to log out and log in again, or log in through a different account  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This one of the standard features for this app. Prototyping because while creating the basic paper prototyping for the app we get to know this must be included in the app flow.  

5. **Story form**  
**Reason:** To choose or create character and settings.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, Brainstorming  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Prototyping is the most effective technique here because it's a visual and interactive way to show the user what they will be interacting with. A brainstorming elicitation technique is being applied because we got this requirement during brainstorming. "Create new story" requirement needs creative and collaborative ideas to define what character the user will use and at what setting the user wants to continue.  

6. **Story generation page**  
**Reason:** Here the user will enter the prompt or the flow of the story.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, Brainstorming  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This functionality is similar to the last one story form. So, the reason for using this elicitation technique in this functional requirement is the same as the last one.  

7. **View previous story**  
**Reason:** Here users will be able to access the previously created stories and will also be able to continue those stories.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** During brainstorming we got this idea that user must be able to access their previous stories.  

8. **Exit (This exit is for exiting the current story)**  
**Reason:** To login users should register first.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This one of the standard features for this app. Prototyping because while creating the basic paper prototyping for the app we get to know this must be included in the app flow.  

9. **Public stories**  
**Reason:** To view stories created by others and also share self created stories.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming, Survey  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming sessions with stakeholders and potential users help generate creative ideas on how stories should be displayed, discovered, and interacted. Since this feature is audience-centric, a large user base needs to be consulted. Surveys allow gathering quantitative data on user preferences.  

10. **Multiplayer**  
**Reason:** More than one user can play a different role in one story and create a story.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming, Survey  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** This idea came in one of the brainstorming sessions of our group. We also took the survey for the feedback on the features of our application and the audience liked this feature the most.  

11. **Personalization**  
**Reason:** Users can personalize their story. Like they decide the genre of the story.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Interview  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** To gather the requirement we took the interview of humanities profs. We interviewed Purbasha Das Ma’am, she suggested this particular idea to us and we also found this one of the useful features.  


# Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
**Reason:** To make sure users don’t experience delays that break immersion while creating or reading stories. Fast response keeps users engaged.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Observation, Prototyping  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** By observing how long users are willing to wait during prototype testing, we can set performance benchmarks for acceptable response times.  

2. **Scalability**  
**Reason:** To ensure the system can handle growth in the number of users without needing a redesign. This makes the app future-proof.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming (Scenario Analysis)  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming possible growth scenarios with stakeholders helps define how many concurrent users to support. Scenario analysis simulates “what if” cases (e.g., sudden user traffic surge).  

3. **Availability and Reliability**  
**Reason:** Users should be able to access the app anytime, and their story progress must be saved reliably even during failures.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, Brainstorming (Scenario Analysis)  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Prototype failures (like simulating server crashes) help reveal reliability gaps. Scenario analysis prepares for situations such as unexpected downtime or network issues.  

4. **Security**  
**Reason:** To protect user credentials, stories, and privacy while preventing unauthorized access.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming, Interviews  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming helps identify possible threats, while interviews with stakeholders clarify what kind of security (encryption, authentication) they expect.  

5. **Usability**  
**Reason:** The app should be simple and fun to use, so users can quickly understand how to create and continue stories.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, User Testing  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Prototypes let users interact with early versions of the app, and usability testing helps refine the interface based on user feedback.  

6. **Maintainability**  
**Reason:** To make it easier for developers to update, debug, and add features without disrupting existing functionality.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming, Interviews  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming helps the team agree on coding standards and modular design. Interviews with developers reveal what they need to make future maintenance easier.  

7. **Portability**  
**Reason:** The app should work smoothly on web, Android, and iOS so users can enjoy it across devices.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, Benchmarking  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Prototypes tested on different devices ensure cross-platform compatibility, while benchmarking compares performance with similar apps.  

8. **Data Integrity**  
**Reason:** To ensure that saved stories and progress are always consistent and not corrupted.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Prototyping, Brainstorming (Scenario Analysis)  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Prototype tests validate save/load functions, while scenario analysis helps define recovery needs in case of partial saves or crashes.  

9. **Backup and Recovery**  
**Reason:** To make sure stories and user progress are not permanently lost if the system fails.  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming (Scenario Analysis)  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming ensures the team considers different backup frequencies and methods. Scenario analysis helps test recovery speed in failure cases.  

10. **Legal & Compliance**  
**Reason:** To protect users and avoid misuse (like underage access to inappropriate content).  
**Elicitation Technique:** Brainstorming  
**Reason for elicitation technique:** Brainstorming possible risks (e.g., age restrictions, content moderation) ensures compliance.
