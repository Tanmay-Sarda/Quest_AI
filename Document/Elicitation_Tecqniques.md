# Stakeholders and Users Elicitation Techniques

## Stakeholders

### 1. Developers
**Brainstorming**  
- **Why:** Developers share ideas about how to build features like dice rolls, branching storylines, and AI response.  
- **How we can use it:** Arrange brainstorming meetings where developers write down all possible ways to implement ideas. For example, one developer may suggest using a random number generator for dice rolls, while another suggests other useful ideas.

**Risk Analysis**  
- **Why:** Developers must think about what challenges or problems they have to face (AI might give inappropriate answers, the server may fluctuate, etc.).  
- **How we can use it:** Create a list of risks (eg., What if too many users play at the same time?). Discuss how to reduce these risks, like using backups.

### 2. QA (Quality Assurance) Engineers and Beta Testers(Users)
**Use Cases & Scenarios**  
- **Why:** QA testers need step-by-step story flows to test.  
- **How to use:** Write scenarios, eg., A user fills in story information, presses save, heads to story page, enters prompt, gets a response, continues entering another prompt. QA then tests if the system gives the right response every time or not.

**Prototyping**  
- **Why:** QA Engineers can make an early working model of the system and understand what needs to be tested. Prototyping helps them to spot issues with story branching, dice roll.  
- **How to Use It:** Give QA Engineers access to a prototype (like a demo with character selection, and story creation). They can try different paths, and note where things may break or be confusing. Eg. - If the AI breaks when using an unfamiliar character in an unrelated setting. This helps us test functionalities and plan detailed test cases later.

### 3. Website Analyst
**Brainstorming**  
- **Why:** Website Analysts track success, so they need to define what to measure (e.g., how long users play, how many choices they make).  
- **How to use:** Create a list of questions like: Which data do you need to know if the platform is successful?, How often do players finish a story or leave it in between the conversation?

### 4. Domain Expert (Humanity Professors)
**Interview**  
- **Why:** To ask questions on both their earlier knowledge of generating text, and inputs on our current plans.  
- **How to use it:** Conduct interview with humanity professors and ask questions such as:  
  - Have you ever used AI for text generation before?  
  - Any suggestion or additional feature you want to add in our project?  
  - What critiques do you have with our approach?  
  - Do you think our app has a demographic?

## Users

### Common Elicitation Technique
**Questionnaires**  
- **Why:** A short and simple interaction, surveys are best to know what most users like.  
- **How to use:** Ask questions pertaining to how exciting they find the overall idea and each feature to be.

### 1. Casual Storytelling Enjoyers
*Interviews*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* This is probably the largest demographic, as others are niches. We need to know if there will be aspects of our software they enjoy.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Conduct interview and ask questions such as:  
  - Have you ever used AI for making stories before?  
  - Any suggestion or additional feature you want to add in our project?  
  - What critiques do you have with our approach?  
  - Do you think our app has a demographic, including you?

*Prototyping*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* Shows if the design is simple enough for casual fun.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Let them test a very basic version where they just pick a setting and character and see the story and make suggestions.

---

### 2. RPG (Role Playing Game) Players
*Interviews*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* RPG players like complex systems, so interviews help understand details like stats, quests, and dice fairness.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Conduct interview and ask questions such as:  
  - Do you have previous experiences of using AI to generate text unrelated to non-fiction?  
  - Any suggestion or additional feature you want to add in our project?  
  - What critiques do you have with our approach?  
  - Do you think our app has a demographic, including you?  
  - What are your expectations in branching stories, dice rolls and role?

*Prototyping*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* Shows if the idea of this is appealing to RPG Players.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Let them test a very basic version where they just pick a setting and character and see the story and make suggestions.

---

### 3. FanFic Enjoyers
*Interviews*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* Fanfic readers and writers often care about genres, characters, and personalization. We need to know if these are suitable additional features.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Conduct interview and ask questions such as:  
  - Have you ever used AI for making fanfics before?  
  - Any suggestion or additional feature you want to add in our project?  
  - What critiques do you have with our approach?  
  - Do you think our app has a demographic, including you?

*Prototyping*  
•⁠  ⁠*Why:* FanFic enjoyers are creative users they don’t just read they add twists so prototype that will let us see how they actually interact with AI.  
•⁠  ⁠*How to use:* Let them try a prototype where they can make a story of their own ideas and give feedback.
